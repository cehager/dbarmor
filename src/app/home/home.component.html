      <p>
        Keeping your data safe is critical. The mathmatical probability of cracking a dbARMORED encrypted text,
        20 characters in length, is beyond the scope of visibility (mathmatical infinity).
        Think of the number one followed by 200 zeroes. Longer texts get more and more probability zeroes added. Hackers lose.
      </p>
      <p>
        The "brute force" method of cracking will not work with dbARMOR. When brute force methods fail, hackers start looking for
        "keys". With dbARMOR there are no special keys lying around for hackers to find.
        Encrypted dbARMOR A-mails are nothing but crackproof giberish!
      </p>
      <p>
        dbARMOR can encrypt and/or decrypt 44 million words, approximately 220 million
        characters, in 2 seconds or less using an average desktop computer running in a single "thread".
         That's about the same word count contained in the entire Encyclopedia Britannica!

        The above text is a real example of what dbARMOR encrypted data looks like. With most encryption systems everytime the same
        text is encrypted, the encrypted results are always the same. dbARMOR generates a totally different set of encrypted
        data even if the same text is encrypted multiple times.

        In addition to sending crackproof emails, there are plenty of other reasons for keeping your information private.
        Here are just a few:
      </p>
      <p>
        Keeping a daily log or diary is now possible without having to worry about snoops. Write your own autobiography. Create a book/novel
        and keep it private until you are ready to share it with family, friends or even the entire world! You can keep ALL
        your data safe with dbARMOR.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have information that you want to keep private then dbARMOR is your best choice.
      </p>
    </p-panel>
  </div>
  <div class="card ui-md-3">
    <p-panel header="4. No SPAN, No Ads, No Pests" [style]="{'height':'512px'}" [toggleable]="false">
      <p>
        Our primary mission at dbARMOR is to keep all your information private and not share anything. However,
        should you want to share information with friends and family (who are also dbARMOR members) you can, it's very easy
        and 100% secure. There are no friends-of-friends who you don't know. There is never any spam or advertising.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first time you send a ARMORED email to a friend or recieve an ARMORED email from a friend, you will need to approve their request. Then
        you can begin exchanging ARMORED messages just like regular email except your dbARMOR (A-mail) is crackproof.
      </p>
      <p>
        With extra sensitive information (like a diary) you can add a secret pin number that is required in order to decrypt your
        private memories.
